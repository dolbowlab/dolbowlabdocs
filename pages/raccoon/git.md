## Summary

It is recommended to familiarize yourself with Git. Git is used for version control in RACCOON and MOOSE.

I would recommend browsing over [this introduction](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual). There are plenty of video introductions/tutorials as well that you can find with a quick google search.
